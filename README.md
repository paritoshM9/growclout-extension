Please note: 

* We have kept privacy in mind. Users get an option on if they want to share their analytics data with public or not. If they disable public access, they can track their own data but not anyone else's data and vice versa. 

* When a user first joins GrowClout, it starts tracking the BitClout data (coin price, followers, market capital) from that point onwards. It doesn't have the ability to show data before that point. 

* You can see other creators' data only if they have also joined BitClout and have enabled public access. 

* Once user signs out from GrowClout, the data collection stops until the user signs back in. However no previous data would be lost.
